# Sending Notifications

Mini Apps can send send notifications to users who have added the Mini App to
their Farcaster client and enabled notifications.

## Overview

At a high-level notifications work like so:
- when enables notifications for your app, the Farcaster client (i.e. Warpcast)
hosting your app will generate a notification token for that user and send it
to your server
- to send a notification to a user, make a request to host's servers with the
notification token and content
- if a user later disables notifications, you'll receive another event indicating
the user is unsubscribed and the notification token is no longer valid


## Steps 

::::steps
### Listen for events 

You'll need a server to receive webhook events and a database to store
notification tokens for users:
- **Managed** - If you'd rather stay focused on your app, use
[Neynar](https://neynar.com) to manage notification tokens on your behalf:<br />
[Setup a managed notifications server with
Neynar](https://docs.neynar.com/docs/send-notifications-to-frame-users#step-1-add-events-webhook-url-to-frame-manifest).
- **Roll your own** - If you want to host your own notification server:<br />
[Follow the Receiving Webhooks guide](/docs/guides/webhooks).


### Add your webhook URL in `farcaster.json`

If you haven't already, follow the [Publishing your app](/docs/guides/publishing) guide to host a
`farcaster.json` on your app's domain.

Define the `webhookUrl` property in your app's configuration in `farcaster.json`: 

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "eyJmaWQiOjU0NDgsInR5cGUiOiJjdXN0b2R5Iiwia2V5IjoiMHg2MWQwMEFENzYwNjhGOEQ0NzQwYzM1OEM4QzAzYUFFYjUxMGI1OTBEIn0",
    "payload": "eyJkb21haW4iOiJleGFtcGxlLmNvbSJ9",
    "signature": "MHg3NmRkOWVlMjE4OGEyMjliNzExZjUzOTkxYTc1NmEzMGZjNTA3NmE5OTU5OWJmOWFmYjYyMzAyZWQxMWQ2MWFmNTExYzlhYWVjNjQ3OWMzODcyMTI5MzA2YmJhYjdhMTE0MmRhMjA4MmNjNTM5MTJiY2MyMDRhMWFjZTY2NjE5OTFj"
  },
  "frame": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Example Frame",
    "iconUrl": "https://example.com/icon.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://example.com",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.png",
    "buttonTitle": "Check this out",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://example.com/splash.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#eeccff",
    "webhookUrl": "https://example.com/api/webhook" // [!code focus] 
  }
}
```

For a real example, this is Yoink's manifest:

### Get users to add your app

For a Mini App to send notifications, it needs to first be added by a user to
their Farcaster client and for notifications to be enabled (these will be
enabled by default). 

Use the [addFrame](/docs/actions/add-frame) action while a user is using your app to prompt
them to add it:

TODO screenshot of add frame
TODO link to addFrame reference


### Save the notification tokens

When notifications are enabled, the Farcaster client generates a unique
notification token for the user. This token is sent webhook endpoint along with
a `url` that the frame should call to send a notification. 

The `token` and `url` need to be securely saved to database so they can be
looked up when you want to send a notification to a particular user.


### Send a notification

Once you have a notification token for a user, you can send them a notification
by sending a `POST` request the `url` associated with that token. 

[Example code to send a
notification](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/7905a24b7cd254a77a7e1a541288379b444bc23e/src/app/api/send-notification/route.ts#L25-L65)

TODO snippest / example 

Here are the types:

```ts
export const sendNotificationRequestSchema = z.object({
  notificationId: z.string().max(128),
  title: z.string().max(32),
  body: z.string().max(128),
  targetUrl: z.string().max(256),
  tokens: z.string().array().max(100),
});
export type SendNotificationRequest = z.infer<
  typeof sendNotificationRequestSchema
>;

export const sendNotificationResponseSchema = z.object({
  result: z.object({
    successfulTokens: z.array(z.string()),
    invalidTokens: z.array(z.string()),
    rateLimitedTokens: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});
export type SendNotificationResponse = z.infer<
  typeof sendNotificationResponseSchema
>;
```

The request is a JSON consisting of:

- `notificationId`: a string (max size 128) that serves as an idempotency key
and will be passed back to the frame via context. A Farcaster client should
deliver only one notification per user per `notificationId`, even if called
multiple times.
- `title`: title of the notification, max 32 characters
- `body`: body of the notification, max 128 characters
- `targetUrl`: the target frame URL to open when a user clicks the
notification. It must match the domain for which the notification token was
issued. Max 256 characters.
- `tokens`: an array of tokens (for that `url`) to send the notification to.
Max 100 per call.

Note that client servers may impose rate limits per `token`. Warpcast enforces the following rate limits:

- 1 notification per 30 seconds per `token`
- 100 notifications per day per `token`

The response from the client server must be an HTTP 200 OK, with a `result` object that contains 3 arrays:

- `successfulTokens`: tokens for which the notification succeeded, including
those for which the request is a duplicate (same `notificationId` used before)
- `invalidTokens`: tokens which are no longer valid and should never be used
again. This could happen if the user disabled notifications.
- `rateLimitedTokens`: tokens for which the rate limit was exceeded. Frame
server can try later.

Once a user clicks the notification, the Farcaster client will:

- Open `targetUrl`
- Set the `context.location` to a `FrameLocationNotificationContext`

```ts
export type FrameLocationNotificationContext = {
  type: 'notification';
  notification: {
    notificationId: string;
    title: string;
    body: string;
  };
};
```
