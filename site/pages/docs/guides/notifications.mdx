# Sending Notifications

Mini Apps can send send notifications to users who have added the Mini App to
their Farcaster client and enabled notifications.

  In Warpcast, these are **in-app notifications** that trigger the red dot on the
  notifications tab. At this stage there is no support for push notifications.
</div>


## Overview

At a high-level notifications work like so:
- when enables notifications for your app, the Farcaster client (i.e. Warpcast)
hosting your app will generate a notification token for that user and send it
to your server
- to send a notification to a user, make a request to host's servers with the
notification token and content
- if a user later disables notifications, you'll receive another event indicating
the user is unsubscribed and the notification token is no longer valid


## Steps 

::::steps
### Listen for events 

You'll need a server to receive webhook events and a database to store
notification tokens for users:
- **Managed** - If you'd rather stay focused on your app, use
[Neynar](https://neynar.com) to manage notification tokens on your behalf:<br />
[Setup a managed notifications server with
Neynar](https://docs.neynar.com/docs/send-notifications-to-frame-users#step-1-add-events-webhook-url-to-frame-manifest).
- **Roll your own** - If you want to host your own notification server:<br />
[Build a notifications server](#roll-your-own-notifications-server).


### Add your webhook URL in `farcaster.json`

If you haven't already, follow the [Publishing your app](/docs/guides/publishing) guide to host a
`farcaster.json` on your app's domain.

Define the `webhookUrl` property in your app's configuration in `farcaster.json`: 

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "eyJmaWQiOjU0NDgsInR5cGUiOiJjdXN0b2R5Iiwia2V5IjoiMHg2MWQwMEFENzYwNjhGOEQ0NzQwYzM1OEM4QzAzYUFFYjUxMGI1OTBEIn0",
    "payload": "eyJkb21haW4iOiJleGFtcGxlLmNvbSJ9",
    "signature": "MHg3NmRkOWVlMjE4OGEyMjliNzExZjUzOTkxYTc1NmEzMGZjNTA3NmE5OTU5OWJmOWFmYjYyMzAyZWQxMWQ2MWFmNTExYzlhYWVjNjQ3OWMzODcyMTI5MzA2YmJhYjdhMTE0MmRhMjA4MmNjNTM5MTJiY2MyMDRhMWFjZTY2NjE5OTFj"
  },
  "frame": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Example Frame",
    "iconUrl": "https://example.com/icon.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://example.com",
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.png",
    "buttonTitle": "Check this out",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://example.com/splash.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#eeccff",
    "webhookUrl": "https://example.com/api/webhook" // [!code focus] 
  }
}
```

### Get users to add your app

For a Mini App to send notifications, it needs to first be added by a user to
their Farcaster client and for notifications to be enabled (these will be
enabled by default). 

Use the `addFrame` action while a user is using your app to prompt
them to add it:

TODO screenshot of add frame
TODO link to addFrame reference


### Save the notification tokens

When notifications are enabled, the Farcaster client generates a unique
notification token for the user. This token is sent webhook endpoint along with
a `url` that the frame should call to send a notification. 

The `token` and `url` need to be securely saved to database so they can be
looked up when you want to send a notification to a particular user.


### Send a notification

Once you have a notification token for a user, you can send them a notification
by sending a `POST` request the `url` associated with that token. 

[Example code to send a
notification](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/7905a24b7cd254a77a7e1a541288379b444bc23e/src/app/api/send-notification/route.ts#L25-L65)

TODO snippest / example 

Here are the types:

```ts
export const sendNotificationRequestSchema = z.object({
  notificationId: z.string().max(128),
  title: z.string().max(32),
  body: z.string().max(128),
  targetUrl: z.string().max(256),
  tokens: z.string().array().max(100),
});
export type SendNotificationRequest = z.infer<
  typeof sendNotificationRequestSchema
>;

export const sendNotificationResponseSchema = z.object({
  result: z.object({
    successfulTokens: z.array(z.string()),
    invalidTokens: z.array(z.string()),
    rateLimitedTokens: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
});
export type SendNotificationResponse = z.infer<
  typeof sendNotificationResponseSchema
>;
```

The request is a JSON consisting of:

- `notificationId`: a string (max size 128) that serves as an idempotency key
and will be passed back to the frame via context. A Farcaster client should
deliver only one notification per user per `notificationId`, even if called
multiple times.
- `title`: title of the notification, max 32 characters
- `body`: body of the notification, max 128 characters
- `targetUrl`: the target frame URL to open when a user clicks the
notification. It must match the domain for which the notification token was
issued. Max 256 characters.
- `tokens`: an array of tokens (for that `url`) to send the notification to.
Max 100 per call.

Note that client servers may impose rate limits per `token`. Warpcast enforces the following rate limits:

- 1 notification per 30 seconds per `token`
- 100 notifications per day per `token`

The response from the client server must be an HTTP 200 OK, with a `result` object that contains 3 arrays:

- `successfulTokens`: tokens for which the notification succeeded, including
those for which the request is a duplicate (same `notificationId` used before)
- `invalidTokens`: tokens which are no longer valid and should never be used
again. This could happen if the user disabled notifications.
- `rateLimitedTokens`: tokens for which the rate limit was exceeded. Frame
server can try later.

Once a user clicks the notification, the Farcaster client will:

- Open `targetUrl`
- Set the `context.location` to a `FrameLocationNotificationContext`

```ts
export type FrameLocationNotificationContext = {
  type: 'notification';
  notification: {
    notificationId: string;
    title: string;
    body: string;
  };
};
```

## Roll your own notifications server

:::note
For a complete example, check out the [Frames V2 Demo
](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo) has all of the above:

- [Handles webhooks](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/main/src/app/api/webhook/route.ts) leveraging the [`@farcaster/frame-node`](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames/tree/main/packages/frame-node) library that makes this very easy
- [Saves notification tokens to Redis](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/main/src/lib/kv.ts)
- [Sends notifications](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/main/src/lib/notifs.ts)
:::

### Handle webhook events

Farcaster clients will POST events to your `webhookUrl` informing you when a user:

- Adds the frame to the client (`frame_added`)
- Removes the frame from the client which disables notifications
(`frame_removed`)
- Enabled notifications (`notifications_enabled`)
- Disables notifications (`notifications_disabled`)

Your endpoint should return a 200 response. It is up to Farcaster clients how
often and for how long they retry in case of errors.

Events use the [JSON Farcaster
Signature](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/protocol/discussions/208) format,
signed with the app key of the user. The data you'll receive is:

```ts
{
  header: string;
  payload: string;
  signature: string;
}
```

All 3 values are `base64url` encoded. The payload and header can be decoded to
JSON.

The `header` JSON has 3 properties:

- `fid`: the FID of the user triggering the event
- `type`: the type of signature, always `app_key`
- `key`: the app key (onchain signer) public key

The `payload` JSON differs per event, see below.

The
[`@farcaster/frame-node`](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames/tree/main/packages/frame-node)
library makes handling very easy. The only thing it requires is a method that
validates that the app key belongs to the FID and returns the Farcaster client
FID. An implementation that uses [Neynar](https://neynar.com) is provided.
Check out the
[README](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames/tree/main/packages/frame-node)
and [see how it's used in the Frames V2 Demo
frame](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames-v2-demo/blob/main/src/app/api/webhook/route.ts).

### Events

#### `frame_added`

Sent when the user adds the frame to their Farcaster client (whether or not
this was triggered by an `addFrame()` prompt).

The optional `notificationDetails` object provides the `token` and `url` if the
client equates adding to enabling notifications (Warpcast does this).

Webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "frame_added",
  "notificationDetails": {
    "url": "https://api.warpcast.com/v1/frame-notifications",
    "token": "a05059ef2415c67b08ecceb539201cbc6"
  }
}
```

```tsx
type EventFrameAddedPayload = {
  event: 'frame_added';
  notificationDetails?: FrameNotificationDetails;
};
```

#### `frame_removed`

Sent when a user removes a frame, which means that any notification tokens for
that fid and client app (based on signer requester) should be considered
invalid:

Webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "frame_removed"
}
```

#### `notifications_disabled`

Sent when a user disables frame notifications from e.g. a settings panel in the
client app. Any notification tokens for that fid and client app (based on
signer requester) should be considered invalid:

Webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "notifications_disabled"
}
```

#### `notifications_enabled`

Sent when a user enables frame notifications (e.g. after disabling them, or if
this is a separate step from adding a frame to the client). The payload
includes a new `token` and `url`:

Webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "notifications_enabled",
  "notificationDetails": {
    "url": "https://api.warpcast.com/v1/frame-notifications",
    "token": "a05059ef2415c67b08ecceb539201cbc6"
  }
}
```

```tsx
type EventNotificationsEnabledPayload = {
  event: 'notifications_enabled';
  notificationDetails: FrameNotificationDetails;
};
```
