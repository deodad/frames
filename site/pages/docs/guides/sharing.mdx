# Sharing your app

Mini Apps can be shared in social feeds using special embeds called Frames that
let users interact with an app directly from their feed.

Each URL in your application can be turned into a Frame by adding meta tags to
it that specify an image and action, similar to how Open Graph tags work.

For example:
- a personality quiz app can let users share a personalized Frame with their results
- an NFT marketplace can let users share a Frame for each listing
- a prediction market app can let users share a Frame for each market

## Making a page sharable

Add a special meta tag in the `<head>` section of the page you want to make
sharable specifying the Frame metadata:

```html
<meta name="fc:frame" content="<stringified FrameEmbed JSON>" />
```

```ts
type FrameEmbed = {
  // Frame spec version. Required.
  // Example: "next"
  version: 'next';

  // Frame image.
  // Max 512 characters.
  // Image must be 3:2 aspect ratio and less than 10 MB.
  // Example: "https://yoink.party/img/start.png"
  imageUrl: string;

  // Button attributes
  button: {
    // Button text.
    // Max length of 32 characters.
    // Example: "Yoink Flag"
    title: string;

    // Action attributes
    action: {
      // Action type. Must be "launch_frame".
      type: 'launch_frame';

      // App name
      // Max length of 32 characters.
      // Example: "Yoink!"
      name: string;

      // Frame launch URL.
      // Max 512 characters.
      // Example: "https://yoink.party/"
      url: string;

      // Splash image URL.
      // Max 512 characters.
      // Image must be 200x200px and less than 1MB.
      // Example: "https://yoink.party/img/splash.png"
      splashImageUrl: string;

      // Hex color code.
      // Example: "#eeeee4"
      splashBackgroundColor: string;
    };
  };
};
```

You can use the [Warpcast Frame Debug Tool] to preview your Frame.

When a user shares the URL with your Frame on it in a Farcaster client, the
Farcaster client will fetch the HTML, see the `fc:frame` meta tag, and use it
to render a rich card.


## Caching

Since Frames are shared feeds, they are generally scraped once and cached so
that they can be efficiently served in the feeds of hundreds or thousands
users.

This means that when a URL gets shared, the Frame data present at that time
will be attached to the cast and won't be updated even if the Frame data at
that URL gets changed.

## Advanced Topics 

### Dynamic Frame images

Even though the Frame data attached to a specific cast is static, a dynamic
image can be served using tools like Next.js
[Next ImageResponse](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/image-response).

For example, we could create a Frame that shows shows the current price of ETH. We'd
set the `imageUrl` to a static URL like `https://example.xyz/eth-price.png`. When a request
is made to this endpoint we'd:

- fetch the latest price of ETH (ideally from a cache)
- renders an image using a tool like [Vercel
  OG](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/og-image-generation) and returns it
- sets the following header: `Cache-Control: public, immutable, no-transform,
  max-age=300`

#### Setting `max-age`

You should always set a non-zero `max-age` (outside of testing) so that the
image can get cached and served from CDNs, otherwise users will see a gray
image in their feed while the dynamic image is generated. You'll also quickly
rack up a huge bill from your servie provider. The exact time depends on your
application but opt for the longest time that still keeps the image reasonably
fresh. If you're needing freshness less than a minute you should reconsider 
your design or be prepared to operate a high performance endpoint.

- [Vercel Docs - OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/docs/og-image-generation)

#### Avoid caching fallback images

If you are generating a dynamic images there's a chance something goes wrong when
generating the image (for instance, the price of ETH is not available) and you need
to serve a fallback image. 

In this case you should use an extremely short or even 0 `max-age` to prevent the
error image from getting stuck in any upstream CDNs.
