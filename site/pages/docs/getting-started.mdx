# Getting Started

## Overview

Mini Apps are web apps built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that integrate with
Farcaster clients using an SDK and publish metadata that Farcaster clients use
to surface them as applications.

## Automatic Setup

For new projects, you can use setup an app using the
[@farcaster/create-mini-app](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/frames/tree/main/packages/create-mini-app)
CLI. This will create a new project using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) React and
TypeScript and install the required dependencies.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm create @farcaster/mini-app
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/mini-app
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/mini-app
```


If you're looking for something

If you're looking for something more opionated, check out the
[create-neynar-farcaster-frame](https://github.com/neynarxyz/create-neynar-farcaster-frame)
tool that uses Next and includes a backend, dynamic image generation, and
integration with Neynar.

Remember, you can use whatever your favorite web framework is to build Mini
Apps so if these options aren't appealing you can setup the SDK in your own
project by following the instructions below.


## Manual Installation

For existing projects, install the Frames SDK:


### Package Manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

:::

### CDN

If you're not using a package manager, you can also use the Frame SDK via an
ESM-compatible CDN such as esm.sh. Simply add a `<script type="module">` tag to
the bottom of your HTML file with the following content.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { sdk } from 'https://esm.sh/@farcaster/frame-sdk'
</script>
```

## Using the SDK

### Calling ready

A splash screen is shown to the user (more on this later) when they app is
loaded. You'll need to call `ready` when your interface is ready to be
displayed:

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'

// ---cut---
await sdk.actions.ready();
```

### Previewing your app

This app doesn\'t do anything interesting yet but we\'ve done now done the bare
mininum to render the application inside a Farcaster client.

Let's preview it in Warpcast:
1. Open the [Warpcast Frame Developer Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames) on desktop
2. Enter your web app url in _Frame URL_ in the **Preview Frame** tool
3. Hit _Preview_

## Next Steps

You'll need to do a few more things before distributing your app to users:
1. publish the app by providing information about who created it and how it should displayed
2. make it sharable in feeds
