# Getting Started

## Overview

Mini Apps are web apps built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that natively
integrate with Farcaster clients using an SDK.

To get started, use your favorite web framework (or just plain HTML and
JavaScript) to setup a basic web application. If you aren't sure which one to
use we recommend
[Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project). 

## Installation

Install the Frames SDK into your project.


### Package Manager

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add @farcaster/frame-sdk
```

:::

### CDN

If you're not using a package manager, you can also use the Frame SDK via an
ESM-compatible CDN such as esm.sh. Simply add a `<script type="module">` tag to
the bottom of your HTML file with the following content.

```html
<script type="module">
  import { sdk } from 'https://esm.sh/@farcaster/frame-sdk'
</script>
```

## Calling Ready

When a user launches a frame, a splash screen is shown (more on this later) to
the user until the application signals that it's ready to be shown to the user:

```ts twoslash
import { sdk } from '@farcaster/frame-sdk'

// ---cut---
await sdk.actions.ready();
```

## Previewing Your Mini App

There is a lot you can do to make an engaging application but this is minimum
you need to do to turn your web application into a frame.

Let's preview it in Warpcast:

1. Open the [Warpcast Frame Developer Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames) on desktop
2. Enter your web app url in _Frame URL_ in the **Preview Frame** tool
3. Hit _Preview_
