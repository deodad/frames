# LLMs

These docs are LLM friendly so that you use the latest models to build your
applications.

1. Use the Ask in ChaptGPT buttons available on each page to interact with the
that page in 

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source src="/ask_in_chatgpt.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

2. Use the [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) to keep your LLM up to date with these docs:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcSet="/cursor-setup-dark.png" />
  <img alt="setup mini app docs in cursor" src="/cursor-setup-light.png" width="auto" />
</picture>

<div style={{textAlign: "center", color: "#757575" }}>
  Adding the Mini App docs to Cursor
</div>

### How does this work?

This entire site is converted into a single markdown doc that can fit inside
the context window of most LLMs. See [The /llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org/)
standards proposal for more information.
